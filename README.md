# rock-paper-scissors

First JavaScript program for a simple rock paper scissors game (playing against the computer). 

Results and input will be displayed in the console for now

- Computer able to randomize selection
- User able to input selection (though invalid input returns 'undefined' rather than alert)

- Console returns appropriate results based on user inputs and allows case insensitivity

- Score keeping added but computer always wins as a result of undefined > user input
- Changed randomized computer choice to picking between a random number between 0 and 1, rather than switching from case to case
- Do-while loop (had to google this one) added to make the game playable
